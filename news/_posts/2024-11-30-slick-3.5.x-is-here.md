title: Slick 3.5.x is here!
author: Naftoli Gugenheim
---

Slick 3.5.0 was released earlier this year with support for Scala 3! As of Slick 3.5.2 a minimum Java version of 11 is now required.

The latest docs are at <https://scala-slick.org/doc/stable/>.


## How to upgrade

In many cases, upgrading should just be a matter of setting the version to `3.5.2` in your build files. (Or, give [Scala Update](https://github.com/kitlangton/scala-update) a try.)
However, a number of deprecated APIs have been dropped in 3.5.0. You should fix any deprecation warnings before upgrading. See [the upgrade guide](https://scala-slick.org/doc/prerelease/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-4-x-to-3-5-0) in case any changes do affect you.
